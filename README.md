# Dotfiles

Personal configuration files

## Installation

Install using the bash script provided;

```
./install
```

This creates symlinks to the dotfiles in the dotfile directory (repository). The mapping between repository dotfile and symlink location is defined by the associative arrays in the installation script, and can be modified as necessary. 

**N.b. The symlinks created by the installation script will overwrite exisiting destination files**
